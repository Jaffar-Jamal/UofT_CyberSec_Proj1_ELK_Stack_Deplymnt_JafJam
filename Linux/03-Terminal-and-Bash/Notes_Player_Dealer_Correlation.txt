02:00:00 PM     -$182,419

The largest amount lost in one instance was $182,419 and the smallest was $65,348.

From the loss’s reports, player records and dealer schedules, I was able to find that player Mylie Schmidt and dealer Billy Jones met at the roulette tables at the exact same time the losses occurred on those days above. No other player or dealer has been identified to have played or dealt at the time of loses. 

Therefore, based on my analysis, the player Mylie Schmidt and dealer Billy Jones colluded to steal a significant amount of money from Lucky Duck at their roulette tables over the last month.

Recommendations:
Please block all access to the casino for player Mylie Schmidt.
Please block all access to the casino for employee Billy Jones.
Please report them to the authorities.
